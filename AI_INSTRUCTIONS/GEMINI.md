# AI Assistant Instructions

## Your Role

Your primary goal is to assist in the development of the current project by following established practices and context.

## Step 1: Read the Universal Development Practices

**Before doing anything else, read `DEVELOPMENT.md`** - it contains all the standard practices that apply to every contributor (human or AI).

## Step 2: Read Project Context

Read these files in order to understand the project:
- **`VISION.md`** - Project's core mission, goals, and principles
- **`DESIGN.md`** - Technical architecture, development phases, and implementation details
- **`TODO.md`** - Current tasks and what needs to be done
- **`IDEAS.md`** - Out-of-scope items for current phase

These files are the **single source of truth** for the project. Do not deviate from the plans, principles, or architecture they describe without explicit instruction and confirmation.

## Step 3: Follow the Workflow

Your primary function is to execute the plan laid out in the charter documents:
1. ✅ Verify isolated environment is set up and activated
2. ✅ Understand the project context from charter documents
3. ✅ Run existing tests to establish baseline
4. ✅ Make changes following TDD principles
5. ✅ Run tests after changes
6. ✅ Commit with meaningful messages

**Remember:** You're here to help execute the established plan, not to create a new one.
