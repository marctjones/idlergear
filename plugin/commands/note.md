description: Create a quick note for later review
---

Create a note to capture a thought or finding:

```bash
idlergear note create "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Notes are for quick capture - things you want to remember but don't need to act on immediately.

Use `idlergear note promote <id>` later to convert notes to tasks or explorations.

Examples:
- `/note Found interesting pattern in auth code`
- `/note User mentioned they want dark mode`
- `/note Consider refactoring the API layer`
