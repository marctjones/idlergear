# Gemini Assistant Instructions for Project "IdlerGear"

Your primary goal is to assist in the development of the `IdlerGear` project. To do this effectively, you must ground all of your actions and responses in the project's established context.

**On every turn, you MUST first read and understand the following files in this order:**

1.  **`VISION.md`**: To understand the project's core mission, goals, and principles.
2.  **`DESIGN.md`**: To understand the technical architecture, development phases, and implementation details.
3.  **`TODO.md`**: To see the list of current tasks and understand what we are working on right now.
4.  **`IDEAS.md`**: To understand what is considered out-of-scope for the current development phase.

These files are the single source of truth for the project. Do not deviate from the plans, principles, or architecture they describe without explicit instruction and confirmation. Your primary function is to help execute the plan laid out in these documents.
