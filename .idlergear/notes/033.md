## Cross-Agent Messaging Limitation: No Periodic Polling

Claude Code cannot periodically poll for messages because:

1. **No idle hook** - Claude Code doesn't trigger anything when waiting for user input
2. **No background threads** - MCP servers are request/response only
3. **No timers** - No way to schedule periodic calls

### Current Behavior
- Messages are checked on `user-prompt-submit` hook (start of each interaction)
- Urgent messages are processed and injected into context
- Normal messages become tasks with `[message]` label

### Implications
- Real-time messaging between agents is not possible
- Agent A sends message → Agent B won't see it until their next interaction
- "Urgent" priority only means it's injected into context, not that it interrupts

### Workarounds (not implemented)
1. External `watch` command in separate terminal
2. Daemon-based OS notifications (desktop/terminal bell)
3. Future: If Claude Code adds context injection, daemon could push messages

### Bottom Line
Claude Code is **reactive, not proactive**. It only runs when the user or Claude triggers something.
