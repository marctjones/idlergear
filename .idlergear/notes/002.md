4. "Claude Code Session Analysis - Common Command Patterns" (from earlier)

## Critical Issues Analysis

### Tier 0: Foundation (Must Have Before v1.0)

**Core Infrastructure:**
- #66: Unified daemon architecture ⚡ **BLOCKER** - Many features depend on this
- #112: Watch mode for change monitoring
- #113: Status command (most requested: 238x mentions)
- #114: Session state persistence (#1 pain point: 141x "where did we leave off")

**Why Tier 0?**
- These enable all other features
- Daemon is infrastructure for #19, #21, #22, #23
- Status/Session solve #1 and #2 user pain points

### Tier 1: Core Features (High Value, Medium Effort)

**AI Integration:**
- #22: Autonomous issue management (Level 1 prompting is quick win)
- #95: Proactive task creation testing
- #21: Auto-environment activation

**Documentation Sync:**
- #116: Wiki sync (197x requests)
- #23: Smart commit timing (prevents doc drift)

**Why Tier 1?**
- Build on Tier 0 infrastructure
- High user demand (data-driven)
