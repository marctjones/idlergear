## Decision: Replace Node.js MCP Servers with Python Implementations

### Rationale
User requested creating IdlerGear-native versions of recommended MCP servers instead of using Node.js dependencies.

### Benefits of Python-Native Approach

**1. Single Runtime**
- Eliminate Node.js dependency completely
- Users only need Python + IdlerGear
- Simpler installation, fewer moving parts

**2. Deeper Integration**
- Direct access to IdlerGear's knowledge system
- Task-aware operations (e.g., `git commit-task`, `search_task_files`)
- Unified error handling and logging

**3. Better Control**
- Optimize for token efficiency (our specific use case)
- Add IdlerGear-specific features
- Custom output formats for Goose GUI

**4. Consistency**
- Same codebase, testing, deployment pipeline
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Python developers can contribute more easily

**5. Performance**
- No npx overhead on every call
- Direct Python execution
- Can optimize for AI assistant workloads

### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Complete control over implementation
- Perfect integration with IdlerGear
- Single language ecosystem
- Can optimize for AI use cases

**Cons:**
- More code to maintain (~2000 LOC total)
- Need to keep parity with upstream changes
- Development time investment (16-20 hours total)

### Implementation Plan

Created 3 tasks:
1. **idlergear fs** (#45) - Filesystem operations (12 tools)
2. **idlergear git** (#46) - Git operations + task linking (18 tools)
3. **idlergear pm** (#47) - Process management (12 tools)

Total: ~42 MCP tools, all Python-native

### Philosophy
> "IdlerGear should be a complete, batteries-included AI knowledge management system. Depending on external MCP servers creates fragmentation and complexity. Building our own ensures quality, integration, and single-runtime simplicity."

This aligns with IdlerGear's vision: **unified AI context management**.
