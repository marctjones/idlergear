## Session Summary: Issue Consolidation and Status Command Implementation

### Completed Work

1. **Issue Consolidation**
   - Closed GitHub issue #95 (proactive task creation)
   - Merged #95 requirements into local task #22 (autonomous issue management)
   - Added #95 acceptance criteria to 3-tier autonomous system design

2. **Implemented Issue #113: Status Command**
   - Created `src/idlergear/status.py` with complete status gathering
   - Added CLI command `idlergear status` with --detailed and --json flags
   - Added MCP tool `idlergear_status` for AI integration
   - Comprehensive project status dashboard combining:
     * Tasks (open count, high priority, top 5)
     * Notes (total count, recent 5 with tags)
     * Runs (active count, graceful fallback if backend missing)
     * Git status (uncommitted files, branch, commits, releases)
   - Proper git status parsing preserving leading spaces
   - Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 9a09592)
   - Closed issue #113 on GitHub

### Technical Details

**Status Command Features:**
- Summary mode: One-line overview
- Detailed mode: Full formatted dashboard
- JSON mode: Structured output for tools
- Graceful degradation when run backend not available
- Git status parsing handles all status codes correctly

**Priority Sorting:**
- Tasks sorted by priority (critical → high → medium → low → none) then by created date
- Handles whitespace in priority values from GitHub
- Shows top 5 tasks in detailed view

**Git Integration:**
- Parses `git status --short` output correctly
- Shows branch name, last commit, last release tag
- Counts uncommitted files
- Displays file status codes (M, A, ??, etc.)

### Recommendations for Next Session

Based on the priority analysis completed earlier:

**Tier 0 Foundation (Critical):**
1. **#114: Session persistence** - Addresses #1 user pain point ("where did we leave off?")
   - 141x requests in user sessions
   - Quick to medium effort
   - High impact on user experience

2. **#66: Unified daemon architecture** - Critical blocker
   - Blocks 7+ other issues
   - Large effort but foundational
   - Should be planned in parallel with #114

**Current Status:**
- 44 open issues total
- 3 Tier 0 issues remaining (was 4, completed #113)
- #113 was the identified "quick win" and is now complete

The status command provides immediate value and sets the pattern for other dashboard-style commands (like the planned `idlergear watch` in #112).
