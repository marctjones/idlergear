# IdlerGear

**A knowledge management API that synchronizes AI context management with human project management.**

AI coding assistants are stateless. Every session starts fresh. Knowledge is constantly lost:
- Issues discovered but forgotten next session
- Learnings not recorded for future AI instances
- Script output invisible to other agents
- Project vision drifts without protection
- Multiple AI instances can't coordinate

IdlerGear provides a **command-based API** that manages this knowledge across sessions, machines, and teams.

## Why Not Just AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md defines **file conventions**: "look for vision in docs/VISION.md"

IdlerGear provides a **command-based API**:

```bash
idlergear vision show    # Returns authoritative vision, wherever it's stored
```

The difference:
- **Backend-agnostic** - Same command whether data is in local file, GitHub, or Jira
- **Configurable** - Project decides where data lives, command stays the same
- **Deterministic** - No AI interpretation needed, just run the command

## Design

IdlerGear manages 11 types of knowledge (tasks, reference, explorations, vision, plans, notes, outputs, contexts, configuration, resources, codebase) across four quadrants (local/shared × volatile/persistent).

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full knowledge model and architecture.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marctjones/idlergear.git
cd idlergear
pip install -e .
```

```bash
cd my-project
idlergear init
```

## The Key Insight

**Context management is an AI problem. Project management is a human problem. IdlerGear synchronizes them.**
